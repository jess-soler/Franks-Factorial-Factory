# Franks-Factorial-Factory
In mathematics, the factorial is the product of all positive whole numbers less than or equal to a target number. 

In a math equation, factorial is denoted with an exclamation mark. 

For example: 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

This program will iterate the value from start to end using a for loop.

For every number, multiply by the last product and accumulate the result.
